Your task is to analyze:
1. The user's original request
2. The changes that were made (provided as a diff)
3. Any diagnostics/problems found in the modified files

Provide a structured assessment of whether the changes fulfill the user's request completely.
Your response must be a valid JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "assessment": "A detailed assessment of whether the changes fulfill the user's request completely. If there are issues, clearly identify missing functionality, diagnostics problems, or other issues. If everything looks good, provide a concise summary of the changes.",
  "problems": true/false (boolean indicating whether there are any issues that need to be addressed)
}

Be thorough but concise in your assessment.`;

The previous changes made to the code had some issues that need to be addressed.
Focus specifically on the validation feedback provided in the last AI message.

Your task is to provide a detailed analysis of what needs to be fixed, focusing only on the issues identified in the validation.
For each issue that needs to be fixed, specify:
1. The full file path that needs to be modified
2. A precise description of what changes need to be made to fix the issue

Be thorough and precise in your analysis, explaining why these changes are necessary and how they will address the validation issues.`;
