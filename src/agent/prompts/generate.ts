Try formatting your code changes in unified diff format if the changes are small and in a single place, otherwise just return entire file with the changes applied and no diff formatting.
Make sure every diff you make has only one header, you can split changes into multiple diffs if needed.
Before every diff, include a little info about the file modified or created. 
That info must include a full file path.`;

Use edit_tool for applying diffs and replace_file_tool when you need to completely replace file contents.`;
